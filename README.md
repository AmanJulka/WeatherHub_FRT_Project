# WeatherHub_FRT_Project
Industry Name:- Ed Tech 

Project Title:- WeatherHub

Problem Statement/Opportunity:- To develop this application there was a need to get accurate weather reports for different locations of the earth all at a single place/hub. I used an API (https://api.openweathermap.org/api) which provides accurate weather’s data in my project to overcome the problem.

Project Description:- The WeatherHub application gives accurate information of weather i.e. temperature (in units such as Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit), Speed of wind (in units such as kph and mph). It is very important to check the weather report before takeoff of any flight, launching of satellites and planning for new adventures etc.
At first, I created a React.js Template using Html, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Then created a form by which users can ask for accurate weather reports by entering the location and other different aspects as input then click on Find Weather button.
After that, API is called through Node.js and React technology and the weather report is displayed on user’s screen. At Second Step, I created a Microsoft Azure account for deploying the project into the Server of Microsoft Azure. After creating Azure account, I used Web App Service of Azure. At the end, I uploaded my project on in Azure () and GitHub (https://github.com/AmanJulka/WeatherHub_FRT_Project.git) using Git. Overall, I learned Microsoft Azure Technology and fully enjoyed the whole experience. 
Primary Azure Technology:- Azure Web Apps, App Service, API Apps Other Azure Technologies:- Visual Studio Code, Git
